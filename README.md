# MLH-LHD-Database
This repository contains two simple projects to implement the use of databases.

The project are :-
1. Hospital Management System (HMS)
2. Online Library

The HMS uses a database to store all the details corresponding to patients as well as doctors. It also has an admin who can modify the contents of the database

The Online Library uses a database to store all the details of a book such as Author, Publisher, Price, etc. The database also maintains the details such as issue and return dates of each user. It also has an admin who can modify the contents of the database. 

Both the applications have been developed using PHP and make use of SQL for backend.
